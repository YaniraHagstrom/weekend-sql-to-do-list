# JQUERY & SQL TO-DO List

This objective of this weekend project was to create a full-stack application that could help keep track of tasks to be completed. Using an input, a new task is created and stored in a database. Once a task is complete, a complete button (check mark button) can be clicked which in turn updates the back-end database and renders the completed task to a list of completed tasks. A delete button was also used to allow the user the option of removing any pending or completed task from the DOM and database. 


Using JQUERY, JS and SQL I was able to create client side requests from the server to modify or add data to the server side database and request the data back to be rendered on the DOM.
